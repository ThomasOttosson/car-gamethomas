## Deployment

* The deployment was made through github and Heroku. The step by step process where the following on github: Settings --> Pages --> Source --> Deploy from a branch --> Main --> /(root) --> Save.

The depoyment though Heroku was made using the following steps: 

1. first i typed pip3 freeze > requirements.txt. 

2. I clicked on the button create app, choosed a unique name, picked Europe as a region and then pressed the button create app.

3. I clicked on the settings tab, scrolled down, added buildpacks for python first and node.js as the secondary buildpack and clicked save changes for each buildpack.

4. I clicked on the deploy tab, then pressed to connect with github, after that i searched for my repository and clicked on the connect button in order to link up the Heroku app with the repository code.

5. As a last step i scrolled down to the bottom of the deploy tab and pressed deploy branch which is a manually deployment process through Heroku.
